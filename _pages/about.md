I'm a PhD student at the University of Bristol, part of the [Dynamic Genetics lab](https://dynamicgenetics.org/) in the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/), supervised by Professor Claire Haworth, Dr Oliver Davis and Dr Luke Sloan. My work is funded by a Data Science and AI PhD studentship from the [GW4 MRC BioMed Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.gw4biomed.ac.uk/).

I look at the digital footprints of mental health on social media, and how we can use longitudinal cohort studies to relate digital phenotypes to people's real world experiences.  We do this using a combination of techniques, including qualitative work with cohort study participants, evaluating machine learning models and developing novel visualisations.  

Alongside my PhD work I'm really interested in network perspectives on mental health and relationships, ways of assessing systemic bias in data-driven methodologies, and geographic visualisions of behavioural data.
