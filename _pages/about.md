I'm a PhD student at the University of Bristol, part of the [Dynamic Genetics lab](https://dynamicgenetics.org/) in the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/), supervised by Professor Claire Haworth, Dr Oliver Davis and Dr Luke Sloan. My work is funded by a Data Science and AI PhD studentship from the [GW4 MRC BioMed Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.gw4biomed.ac.uk/).

I look at the digital footprints of mental health on social media, and how we can use longitudinal cohort studies to relate digital phenotypes to people's real world experiences.  We do this using a combination of techniques, from qualitative work with cohort study participants to evaluating machine learning models.  

Alongside my PhD work I'm really interested in network perspectives on mental health and relationships, and ways of assessing systemic bias in data-driven methodologies.
