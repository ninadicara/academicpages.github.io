I'm a PhD student at the University of Bristol, part of the Dynamic Genetics lab in the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit.  

My work considers the digital footprints of mental health, and how we can use longitudinal cohort studies to improve the evidence base by relating digital phenotypes to people's real world experiences.  

We do this using a combination of techniques, from qualitative work with cohort study participants to evaluating machine learning models.  

Alongside my PhD work I'm really interested in network perspectives on mental health and relationships, and ways of assessing systemic bias in data-driven methodologies.
