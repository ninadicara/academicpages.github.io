The COVID-19 Community Map was made through a collaboration between the Dynamic Genetics Lab and Research and Evaluation at Public Health Wales. I was part of the development team for this project, which is pubclically accessible at [covidresponsemap.wales](https://covidresponsemap.wales/)

The code for the project is available [here](https://github.com/DynamicGenetics/COVID-19-Community-Response).

Project motivation: 
"Understanding which communities are vulnerable during this pandemic can help government agencies and third sector organisations consider which areas need the most help. Community support can offer a protective factor against adverse events. Some areas are more vulnerable than others and this map highlights the areas where there is an imbalance between support and need that suggests they could benefit from additional support."
