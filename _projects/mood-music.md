We were [awarded a seedcorn grant by the Jean Golding Institute](https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2020/01/13/jgi-seed-corn-funding-call-winners-2020-announced/) to investigate whether we can use data from Spotify as a signal of wellbeing. This will involve an ecological momentary assessement study to collect data from a group of participants, as well as qualitative focus groups to explore ethics and study design. 

This project involves two main pieces of software. The first is a Telegram app to deliver the EMA questionnaires, and a Django app to administer the study.
