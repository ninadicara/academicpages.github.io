Abstract:
The UKâ€™s population-based birth cohorts have each followed thousands of participants for their
whole lives, collecting diverse social, behavioural, biological and health measurements spanning
decades. New types of data collection such as social media linkage have the potential to enrich
these datasets with high-resolution time course data on real human behaviour. At the same time,
these richly characterised cohorts with gold-standard survey and other measurements collected at
regular intervals could be ideal platforms for the validation of information derived from social media.
Our project, supported by CLOSER, the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the UK
Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Alan Turing Institute, is working in partnership with cohort
participants and leaders to develop a software framework to facilitate social media linkage in the
eight cohorts that make up the CLOSER consortium, starting with a proof-of-principle
implementation in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). To work out the
best way to do this, we are engaging with two generations of ALSPAC participants to find out what
is acceptable to them in terms of collecting and using their interactions on social media. This has
informed the development of software that collects, codes and shares social media data while
protecting the anonymity of participants.
